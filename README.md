[Bike Sales Project](https://github.com/jmamasig/Excel-Projects/blob/main/Bike%20Sales%20-%20Excel%20Project.xlsx)

In this project I cleaned and organized the data provided to make it more usable. I also created several pivot tables for visualizations and created a dashboard for these visualizations. The dashboard contains several slicers for viewers to filter for some key information that may be needed.
